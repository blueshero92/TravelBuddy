## 📖 About the Project

**TravelBuddy** is a server-side rendered web application that allows registered users to browse tourist excursions, create and manage bookings, maintain a favourites list, and submit cancellation requests. Administrators manage the full excursion catalogue and process cancellation requests with approve/decline decisions. The system automatically notifies users of outcomes via an in-app notification inbox.

Built as part of the **ASP.NET Fundamentals** course to demonstrate MVC architecture, Entity Framework Core Code-First, ASP.NET Core Identity, service layer separation, custom validation attributes, and area-based project organisation.

## 🗄️ Database Setup

The project uses **Entity Framework Core** with a Code-First approach and **PostgreSQL** as the database provider (via `Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL`). All entity configurations live in `TravelBuddy.Data/Configuration/`.

> ⚠️ All `DateTime` values are stored as **UTC** (`timestamp with time zone`). Display conversion to local time (Europe/Sofia, UTC+2/+3) is handled via `DateTimeExtensions.ToAppLocalTime()` in `TravelBuddy.Infrastructure`.

### Key Entities

| Entity | Description |
|---|---|
| `ApplicationUser` | Extends ASP.NET Core Identity user with `FullName` |
| `Excursion` | Excursion with title, destination, dates, price, capacity, image |
| `Booking` | Links user to excursion; statuses: Pending / Confirmed / Cancelled |
| `BookingCancellationRequest` | Composite PK (UserId + BookingId); statuses: Pending / Approved / Declined |
| `Notification` | User inbox messages with `IsRead` flag |
| `Favorite` | Composite PK (UserId + ExcursionId) |

Connection string is configured in `appsettings.json`:

```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "TravelBuddyDbConnection": "Host=localhost;Port=5432;Database=TravelBuddy;Username=postgres;Password=yourpassword"
}
```

To apply all migrations:

```bash
dotnet ef database update --project TravelBuddy.Data --startup-project TravelBuddy
```
